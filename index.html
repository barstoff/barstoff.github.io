 <p> I am a joint PhD Researcher in Economics and Data Science at <a href="https://www.imtlucca.it/" style="color:#800000">IMT School for Advanced Studies</a> and <a href="https://feb.kuleuven.be/eng" style="color:#800000">KU Leuven</a>. In 2019, I was a visiting scholar at  <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/" style="color:#800000">Harvard University</a>. </br> </br>

I am fascinated by the application of statistical methods to social and health sciences.
The main fields of my investigation are causal inference, applied machine learning, public policy evaluation and political economy. </br> </br>

Currently, I am working on the applications of machine learning in social and data sciences. In particular, I study methods to improve public policies amid the rampant heterogeneity in the world </br> </br>

Previously, I have been a City Councillor and I got degrees in Statistics and Sociology. </p>
